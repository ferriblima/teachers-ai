1. Definition of Objectives and Scope

    Objective: Create a web chatbot where the user can choose which type of specialist they want to talk to. The target audience is curious children who are not yet familiar with how to construct descriptive prompts.
    Scope: Chatbot, conversation history archiving until reset, web page for interaction, three specialists, three technical levels of explanation.

2. Research and Analysis

    Technologies: ChatGPT API, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Axios.
    Competitors and Inspiration: Reference site with a similar idea: https://kidschatgpt.com/appstore

3. Planning

    System Architecture: Define the basic architecture of your chatbot, including frontend (user interface) and backend (server logic, ChatGPT integration).

    Stage    Activity                            Description                                    Technologies / Tools
    1        Development Environment Setup      Prepare the development environment by        PHP, Apache/Nginx
                                                installing PHP and a web server
                                                (like Apache or Nginx).
    2        User Interface Creation            Develop the web interface, including a        HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                                                textbox for user questions, a send button,
                                                and a reset button.
    3        Integration with ChatGPT API       Implement the client-side logic (JavaScript)  JavaScript, Axios
                                                to send user questions to the ChatGPT API
                                                and receive responses using Axios.
    4        Conversation History Storage       Implement the functionality to archive        JavaScript
                                                questions and responses client-side,
                                                using JavaScript lists, allowing the
                                                conversation to have continuity and memory.
    5        Reset Button Implementation        Implement the functionality to clear the      JavaScript
                                                stored conversation history, allowing
                                                a new conversation to start.
    6        Testing                            Perform tests to ensure that all              JavaScript testing tools (Jest)
                                                functionalities are operating as expected,
                                                focusing on user interface testing and
                                                message storage logic.
    7        Project Documentation              Document the project, including an overview,  Markdown, Git repository (GitHub/GitLab)
                                                instructions on how to configure and run
                                                the bot, descriptions of the APIs and
                                                libraries used, and usage instructions.

    Important Notes:

    - JavaScript and Axios are used for client-side logic, including the user interface and communication with the ChatGPT API. Axios is a popular JavaScript library based on promises for HTTP clients, facilitating HTTP calls.
    - JavaScript lists are used to store the message history in the user's browser, eliminating the need for a database.
    - HTML and CSS are used to structure and style the user interface, respectively.
    - PHPUnit may not be necessary since the focus has shifted to client-side testing. Jest is recommended for testing JavaScript, covering both message storage logic and API integration.
