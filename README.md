## About The Project

Teachers AI Project is a web application designed to integrate artificial intelligence functionalities, using the OpenAI API, to create a virtual assistant aimed at curious children. Users can interact with the assistant through a chat interface to get educational content and assistance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP installed on your system.
- Composer to manage PHP dependencies.
- Chat GPT account to provide the API key.

### Installation

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
   OpenAI Documentation: [https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
3. Install the PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
4. Open the `app/index.html` file in your browser, or start a local PHP server and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

This project uses a chat interface to interact with a virtual assistant for educational purposes. The assistant:
- Answers questions.
- Engages children in a fun and interactive way.

### Main Files
- **proxyOpenAi.php**: A PHP script that acts as a proxy to interact with the OpenAI API, securing the API key.
- **index.js** and **chat.js**: Handle user interaction and requests to the backend.

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic integration with OpenAI API.
- [ ] Add voice interaction support.
